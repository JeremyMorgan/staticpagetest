Static Page Test
==============

This is a static HTML page I use for speed tests. It uses Bootstrap just to throw some generic CSS and JavaScript in but for the most part it's just a giant bunch of text. 

I figured this would be a good way to test static pages generated by things like OctoPress. 

I have a series of tests I ran with this for this hosting speed test on my blog. 

Feel free to use this to test your host, and add anything you think might help.
